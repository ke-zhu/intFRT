Description: Provides tools for estimating and testing the average
    treatment effect (ATE) in hybrid controlled trials, which integrate
    randomized controlled trials with external control data. The package
    implements estimation methods such as IPW, CW, OM, AIPW, and ACW,
    alongside asymptotic inference and Fisher randomization tests (FRT).
    It also features Conformal Selective Borrowing (CSB) to borrow
    comparable external controls, addressing hidden bias.
